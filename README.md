# RSNA Bone Age Prediction Challenge
### Objective:
Develop a deep learning model for automated bone age assessment using hand X-ray images.
### Data and Preprocessing:
In the preprocessing stage of our model development, we divided the data into twenty groups based on sex and bone age score. We then randomly sampled 400 data points from each group, resulting in 8,000 data points. These were further divided into a training set of 6,000 and a validation set of 2,000 points. Finally, we determined that an input pixel dimension of 500 x 500 was optimal for this specific problem.
